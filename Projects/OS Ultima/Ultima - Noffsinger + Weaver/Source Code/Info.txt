The project has been split into a more "readable" section. The project structure is as follows:

...

inc/
	ALL HEADERS

src/ 
	ALL SOURCE

obj/
	ALL OBJECTS

build/
	ALL BUILDS

disk/
	ALL "DISK FILES"

Makefile

...

The Makefile has a few options:
	* "make" to build the project
	* "make clean" to remove objects
	* "make run" to run


If you have any questions, email either of us.
Thanks!
